        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>One bowl, quick, easy and impossible to stuff up!</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1 cup dark chocolate chips or melts/semi-sweet chocolate</li>
                <li>85 g/6 tbsp unsalted butter</li>
                <li>1/4 tsp cooking/kosher salt</li>
                <li>3/4 cup brown sugar</li>
                <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
                <li>2 large eggs</li>
                <li>2/3 cup almond meal/ground almonds</li>
                <li>1/3 cup rice flour</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Instructions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Preheat</strong> the oven to 180°C / 325°F (160°C fan-forced) with a rack in the lower third of the oven.</li>
                <li><strong>Preparation:</strong> Grease and line a 20cm / 8" square pan with baking paper (parchment paper) with excess overhang so it's easy to lift out the brownie when cooked.</li>
                <li><strong>Melt butter and chocolate:</strong> Place chocolate, butter and salt in a heatproof bowl. Microwave in 3 x 30 second bursts on high, mixing in between, until melted and smooth. You could also do this over simmering water on the stove.</li>
                <li><strong>Cool 5 minutes:</strong> Mix well to combine the chocolate and butter then leave to cool for 5 minutes.</li>
                <li><strong>Add vanilla, sugar and eggs:</strong> Stir in the vanilla and sugar. Crack the eggs straight into the bowl, and stir until combined.</li>
                <li><strong>Add dry:</strong> Add almond meal and rice flour, and mix very well until fully combined.</li>
                <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Pour the batter into the prepared pan and smooth the surface. Bake for 25 minutes or until the brownies are slightly puffed all over and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out moist but clean. You want it to be moist!</li>
                <li><strong>Cool and serve:</strong> Cool brownies for at least 30 minutes in the pan. Remove the brownie by holding the edges of the baking paper, fully cool on a rack. Then cut into squares (3 x 3 for gigantic ones, 4 x 4 for sensible ones). See Note 4 for more cutting tips.</li>
